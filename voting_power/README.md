#### Chrome browser plugin for showing Steemit voting power

To install the plugin, it is enough to save the contents of the [repository](https://github.com/AnatoliyStrizhak/steemit/tree/master/voting_power). 
Next, you need to change the username of steemit user in the function get_pwr in steem api call 
( steem.api.getAccounts (['astrizak'] ).

Then go to the browser menu Extensions, click "Load Unpacked extension" and specify the location of the plug-in. 
Well, in addition, you can select the option "Hide from toolbar", since the icon in the browser panel does not carry 
any load (for now).
